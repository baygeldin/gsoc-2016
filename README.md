# GSoC-2016
Here are the sources of my static blog for a GSoC-2016 project.

## How to post
1. Add meta data to `_data.json`
2. Create a Markdown file for an article
3. Run `harp compile` from the root
4. Push `www` folder to `gh-pages` branch

**Note**: it's certainly possible to automate it with CLI (using co-promt & commander), but it's easy enough already :)
