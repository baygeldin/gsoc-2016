# About

The goal of this project is to provide a GUI for GDB in the browser so that other developers can use it to easily and intuitively debug projects running in a cloud environment. It's a Single Page Application which, when given a link to the WebSocket server, provides a web-interface (IDE like) to remotely debug your projects. It can even be run on the GitHub pages! :)
