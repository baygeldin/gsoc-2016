# About

The goal of this project is to provide a GUI for GDB in the browser so that other developers can use it to easily and intuitively debug projects running in a cloud environment. `react-gdb` is a React component that can be embedded into any web page (even GitHub pages!). It supports debugging of multithreaded targets, debugging of multiple targets, setting breakpoints and examining of the callstack.
