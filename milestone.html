        <section class="post-content">
            <h1>Milestone</h1><p>Weekly reports are slowly turning into fortnightly reports, heh. But despite this I&#39;m satisfied with the progress. During this time I managed to finish <code>gdb-js</code>, write documentation for it, publish it on npm and set up CI. Also, I fixed the <code>ws-streamify</code> and puzzled out the debugging of multithreaded and multi-process&#39;ed targets in GDB and added the corresponding examples to <code>gdb-examples</code> repo. But what&#39;s more important â€” I&#39;ve finally acquired a good understanding of how the project should be implemented. And in the meantime I&#39;ve passed another exam :D But let&#39;s see it in a little more detail.</p>
<h2>Multithreading</h2><p>Honestly, I hate multithreading :D Except maybe its application to pure functional languages. But for everything else it just sounds scary to me. Deadlocks, unobvious control flow... That&#39;s why I like event-loop. And that&#39;s why I deliberately avoided this topic while I was writing <code>gdb-js</code>. But it couldn&#39;t be postponed forever, so I created a simple yet handy example of multithreaded program for <code>gdb-examples</code> repo: multiple ticket-sellers sell tickets simultanously until there&#39;s no tickets remain. And while playing with it in GDB I understood that <code>non-stop</code> and <code>target-async</code> modes are must have in a GDB frontend. So i included them in <code>gdb-js</code> and then added <code>thread</code> argument to all of the methods where it makes sense. That&#39;s it.</p>
<h2>Multiple targets</h2><p>First off, I read <a href="http://blog.chromium.org/2008/09/multi-process-architecture.html">how it works in Chromium</a> and then <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2016/04/11/the-why-of-electrolysis/">how it&#39;s coming to Firefox</a>. From these articles I understood how important it is to have a multi-process architecture and thus it&#39;s neccessary to have the ability to debug it. However, unlike threads when a process is created it&#39;s not attached to GDB automatically. The exception to this is only systems that support <code>fork</code> and <code>vfork</code>. On other systems (e.g. <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425.aspx">Windows</a>) I believe it should be done manually. But even in this case <a href="https://sourceware.org/gdb/onlinedocs/gdb/Forks.html">it seems that it&#39;s not that straight-forward</a>. So I decided to just add methods for attaching and detaching processes to <code>gdb-js</code> and a method that disables <code>detach-on-fork</code> mode, so that forks will be attached automatically. Also, I&#39;ve created the example of a program with multiple processes (multiple counters) and pushed it to <code>gdb-examples</code> repo.</p>
<h2>Python and CLI commands</h2><p>In previous post I said that MI interface is lacking some commands. But GDB allows to use CLI commands in MI mode with <code>-interpreter-exec console</code>. The only problem with it is getting the results. So I decided to make use of Python and its function <code>gdb.execute(&quot;&lt;CLI command&gt;&quot;, False, True)</code>. In GDB &gt;= 7.3 it has a third argument which when <code>True</code> returns a string with results of CLI command execution. So I wrapped it into an useful command <code>concat</code> which executes given CLI command, adds a given prefix to the results of command execution and prints this in a single MI console record. Also, I&#39;ve created a command <code>info context</code> which takes all variables (globals, static, locals) in the current context and prints a nice JSON. However, getting all (I mean, ALL) globals for the current target is only possible with manually parsing of its symbol table. So I just decided to write one another pegjs parser for the results of <code>info variables</code> command. It all works pretty well. Besides we now have a nice infrastructure to add new functionality to GDB without even bothering the server. However, scripts can be (from my experience) only ~3700 symbols long. Maybe it makes sense to make use of <code>pyminifier</code>. To summarize, this is how I manage the results handling now, it&#39;s an exact copy of the actual flow in the code (I sooo love streams):</p>

<h2>gdb-js</h2><p><a href="https://travis-ci.org/baygeldin/gdb-js">Here&#39;s</a> Travis CI. <a href="http://npmjs.com/package/gdb-js">Here&#39;s</a> the npm package. <a href="https://baygeldin.github.io/gdb-js">Here&#39;s</a> the documentation. I considered several documentation generators, but then just decided to use JSDoc. Although I also like Docco and its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">literate programming philosophy</a>. </p>
<h2>react-gdb</h2><p>Finally, the most important part. Thanks to @jonasf I finally realized the core goals that the project is pursuing and how it should be implemented to fit these goals. Back then I thought that <code>react-gdb</code> is just a static site that needs a link to the WebSocket server to work. This made me think that <code>react-gdb</code> is something that has dependency on the server (and its protocol, of course). But in fact, it&#39;s just a React component that can have a much simpler interface (almost the same as <code>gdb-js</code> has). It can accept a child process (e.g. an instance of <code>docker-exec-websocket-server</code>), source provider and (optionally) debug log provider. Source provider can be implemented as a plain function that accecpts a file name and returns the sources of this file (for Firefox, it can be a hg repository provider, for example). This interface will make <code>react-gdb</code> absolutely server-agnostic, agnostic about the location of sources and reusable. So, that&#39;s it. By the way, I&#39;ve also put a lot of thought on how the UI should look like when I add multithreading and multiple targets support to it. I&#39;ve ended up with something similar to NetBeans approach (with the amendment that I want to group threads by a process):</p>

<h2>P.S.</h2><ul>
<li>As for <code>ws-streamify</code> it now merges the buffers into one message when it&#39;s possible.</li>
<li>I&#39;ve spent some time on improving my vim workflow with a bunch of useful plugins and now I regret not doing it earlier Ñ‚_Ñ‚.</li>
<li>I have an exam on 24th of June. So, I will continue my work on the project after it.</li>
